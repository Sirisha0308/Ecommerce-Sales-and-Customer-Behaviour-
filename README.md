This project demonstrates storing, managing, and analyzing e-commerce sales data using MySQL, Python (Google Colab), and Power BI.
A cleaned CSV containing product codes, descriptions, quantities, prices, customer IDs, and timestamps was imported into MySQL using LOAD DATA INFILE.
The data was structured into relational tables, ensuring accurate data types and handling large quantity values.
SQL queries calculated total revenue, identified top-selling products, and revealed monthly sales patterns.
In Google Colab, Python was used for data cleaning, handling missing values, correcting formats, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn generated statistical summaries and visual insights.
The cleaned dataset was then connected to Power BI via MySQL ODBC for advanced visualization.
Power BI dashboards showcased sales KPIs, product performance, seasonal trends, and regional analysis.
This end-to-end workflow integrates database management, data analysis, and visualization for comprehensive business intelligence.
